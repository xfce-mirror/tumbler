tumbler
====================

Tumbler is a D-Bus service for applications to request thumbnails for
various URI schemes and MIME types. It provides plugin interfaces for 
extending the URI schemes and MIME types for which thumbnails can be 
generated as well as for replacing the storage backend that is used to 
store the thumbnails on disk.
